            <h2>Death Star</h2>
            <p> 
                Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! 
                There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? 
                They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
                Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
                What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah., This is a consular ship.

            <h2>Gold leader</h2>
            <p>
    
            Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front! Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. 
            Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
            I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position.

            <h2>The Empire</h2>
            <p>
            It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire! The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
            It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've. There's another ship coming in.

            <h2>Smuggling</h2>
            <p>    
            I want every part of this ship checked. 
            Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since. 
            Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. 
            I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.

            <h2>Luke</h2>
            <p>  
            And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke.
            But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
            Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
